# History of Satellites

The journey of satellites began in 1957 with the launch of **Sputnik 1** by the Soviet Union, marking the dawn of artificial satellites in Earth's orbit. This landmark achievement ignited the space race between the U.S. and the USSR, resulting in rapid advancements in satellite technology. By 1960, the United States had launched its first satellite, **TIROS-1**, dedicated to weather observation.

Today, satellites are integral to communication, navigation, weather forecasting, and scientific research. Their evolution—from massive geostationary satellites to compact nanosatellites—reflects humanity’s ingenuity and growing reliance on space technology.

## Types of Satellites

Based on size, satellites can be broadly classified into three types.

### 1. Small Satellites (SmallSats)

Small satellites typically weigh under 500 kg. This category includes **CubeSats**, miniature satellites measuring just 10 cm x 10 cm per unit (1U), along with other small-scale satellites ranging from 10 kg to 500 kg. SmallSats are often used for educational, research, and commercial purposes, including Earth observation, communication, and scientific experiments. Their compact size allows for lower launch costs and quicker development cycles.

#### CubeSats

A subset of small satellites, CubeSats are designed for low-cost missions in space, making them ideal for universities, startups, and research institutions.

Nanosatellites often adhere to the CubeSat standard, which defines their structure in modular units of 10x10x10 centimeters. A satellite of this dimension is called a 1U satellite.

#### Mini Satellites

Typically weighing between 100 kg and 500 kg, mini satellites are used for various applications, including communications, Earth observation, and technology demonstration.

### 2. Medium-Sized Satellites (MediumSats)

Medium-sized satellites usually weigh between 500 kg and 2,000 kg. These satellites are employed in missions that require advanced technology or larger payloads than small satellites can offer. Commonly used for commercial communications, scientific research, and remote sensing, MediumSats are also popular for Earth observation and broadcasting services.

### 3. Large Satellites

Large satellites typically exceed 2,000 kg and are among the most complex, expensive, and powerful. They are used for major missions, such as weather forecasting, global communication networks, and scientific research, including space telescopes and exploration missions. These satellites require significant fuel, larger payloads, and advanced technology.

#### Geostationary Satellites

These large communication satellites remain fixed in a specific position relative to Earth, orbiting at an altitude of about 36,000 km. They are critical for broadcasting and telecommunications.

#### Space Telescopes

Satellites like the **Hubble Space Telescope** are designed for long-term scientific missions in deep space exploration. The size of a satellite impacts its design, cost, and intended use. Smaller satellites are often more cost-effective and quicker to deploy, while larger satellites tend to have more complex missions and higher costs but provide greater capacity and longer operational lifespans.
