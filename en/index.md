# ECube User Guide

The E-Cube (_Educational Cube_) is an interactive, non-flight replica of a Nano-satellite. With E-Cube, users can explore and learn the form, structure, and workings of a nano-satellite while gathering diverse skills in 3D assembly, soldering, programming, communication, and mission design.

## What is a Nano-Satellite?

A nanosatellite is a miniature form of satellite with a mass typically ranging between 1 and 10 kilograms. These satellites are designed to perform diverse functions, such as scientific research, Earth observation, communication, and technology validation. Their compact size and advanced design enable them to deliver capabilities comparable to larger satellites while greatly reducing costs.
Nanosatellites often adhere to the CubeSat standard, which defines their structure in modular units of 10x10x10 centimeters. A satellite of this dimension is called a 1U satellite. This standardization enhances cost-efficiency, facilitates streamlined design and manufacturing, and simplifies deployment processes. Due to their affordability and versatility, nanosatellites have become a cornerstone for educational initiatives, innovative research, and commercial applications, democratizing access to space exploration and technology.

<div style="text-align: center;"><i>Nepali-Sat 1</i> </div>

E-Cube is inspired by Nepali Sat 1: The First Nano-Satellite of Nepal. Nepal's first satellite, NepaliSat-1, was a 1U CubeSat developed by Dr. Abhas Maskey, the founder of Antarikchya Pratisthan Nepal, under the Birds-3 program at Kyushu Institute of Technology, Japan.
