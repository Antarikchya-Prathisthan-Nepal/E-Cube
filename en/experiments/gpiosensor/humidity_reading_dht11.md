# Reading Humidity From E-Cube

In this guide, we'll learn how to use the **DHT11** humidity sensor with **E-Cube**. The DHT11 is a simple and low-cost sensor, making it ideal for various environmental monitoring applications.

## **What is Humidity?**
Humidity refers to the amount of water vapor present in the air. It is commonly expressed as **relative humidity (RH)**, which is the percentage of moisture in the air relative to the maximum amount it can hold at a given temperature. High humidity levels can make the air feel warmer, while low humidity can cause dryness and discomfort.

## **Components Required**
- **E-Cube**
- **USB-Wire**
- **PC for programming**

## **Description of DHT11**
The DHT11 is a basic, low-cost digital humidity sensor. It provides a digital signal output, making it easy to interface with microcontrollers like the ESP32-S3 in the E-Cube. The DHT11 can measure humidity from **20% to 90%** with an accuracy of **Â±5%**.

## **How It Works**
The DHT11 sensor contains a capacitive humidity sensor that measures relative humidity. It uses a single-wire digital interface to communicate with the microcontroller, sending humidity data in a specific format. When queried, the sensor sends a series of bits representing the humidity reading.

## **Setup**
Refer to [Soldering](/en/assembly/soldering.md) for a guide if you haven't already attached the **DHT11 sensor** to the **EPS Board**.

## **Code: Reading Humidity from DHT11**

Refer to [Environment Setup](/en/operationguide/environmentsetup.md) and [Executing The Code](/en/operationguide/executingthecode.md) for IDE setup and programming guide.

Upload the following **code** to your E-Cube:

```cpp
#include "DHT.h"

#define DHTPIN 37    // Pin where the DHT11 is connected
#define DHTTYPE DHT11    // DHT 11

DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200); // Initialize serial communication
  dht.begin();          // Initialize the DHT11 sensor
}

void loop() {
  delay(2000); // Wait a few seconds between measurements
  
  float h = dht.readHumidity(); // Read humidity

  if (isnan(h)) { // Check if the reading failed
    Serial.println("Failed to read from DHT sensor!");
    return;
  }

  Serial.print("Humidity: ");
  Serial.print(h);
  Serial.println("%");
}
```

## **Code Overview**
The code initializes the DHT11 sensor and continuously reads the humidity value, printing it to the Serial Monitor.

### Code Breakdown

```cpp
#include "DHT.h"
```
Includes the DHT library, which provides functions to interact with the DHT11 sensor.<br><br>

```cpp
#define DHTPIN 37
```
Defines the GPIO pin connected to the DHT11 sensor.<br><br>

```cpp
DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE);
```
Creates an instance of the DHT class to manage the DHT11 sensor.<br><br>

```cpp
void setup() {
```
Initializes serial communication and the DHT11 sensor.<br><br>

```cpp
void loop() {
```
Reads the humidity every 2 seconds and prints it to the Serial Monitor.<br><br>

```cpp
float h = dht.readHumidity();
```
Reads the humidity value from the DHT11 sensor.<br><br>

```cpp
if (isnan(h)) {
```
Checks if the reading failed (i.e., if it is NaN) and prints an error message if so.<br><br>

This guide ensures that you can successfully read humidity data from the DHT11 sensor on your E-Cube.
