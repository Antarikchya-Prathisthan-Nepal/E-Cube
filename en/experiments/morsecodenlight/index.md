# Morse & Light Communication

This section covers experiments focused on Morse code and light-based communication methods, providing insights into non-traditional communication systems. These experiments are designed to explore innovative ways of transmitting data using light and simple signals, essential for low-bandwidth or emergency communication systems.

## This section includes:

### [Li-Fi Comm](lifi_communication.md)
Learn how to implement Li-Fi communication, where data is transmitted using light. This experiment demonstrates the principles of visible light communication (VLC).

### [Morse LED TX](morse_led_transmitter.md)
Create a Morse code LED transmitter that converts text into Morse code using light. This experiment teaches the basics of Morse code communication.

### [Morse LDR Decoder](morse_ldr_decoder.md)
Decode Morse code signals using a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) to interpret data transmitted through light. This section demonstrates how to receive and decode Morse code signals.
