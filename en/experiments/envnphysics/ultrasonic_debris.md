# **Space Debris Detection using E-Cube**

In this conceptual project, we will use an **ultrasonic sensor** with the **MSN board of E-Cube** to detect objects within a certain range. While **E-Cube cannot be sent to space**, this project serves as an **educational model** for understanding how proximity sensors work in space debris monitoring.

## **What is Space Debris?**
Space debris consists of **defunct satellites, spent rocket stages, and fragmented parts** orbiting Earth. These objects pose a threat to active spacecraft and the **International Space Station (ISS)**. Monitoring and tracking space debris is essential for **collision avoidance and spacecraft safety**.

### **How Can We Simulate Space Debris Detection?**
Since we cannot deploy E-Cube into space, we will **simulate space debris detection** using an **ultrasonic sensor**. The sensor will measure the **distance of objects** in front of it, and if the distance falls **below a certain threshold**, an **LED will glow**, indicating a potential collision.

## **How Does an Ultrasonic Sensor Work?**  

An **ultrasonic sensor** is a device that measures **distance** using **sound waves**. It operates on the principle of **echolocation**, similar to how **bats, dolphins, and submarines** detect objects in their surroundings.  

### **Working Principle**  
The sensor consists of two main components:  
1. **Transmitter** â€“ Sends out high-frequency sound waves (ultrasound).  
2. **Receiver** â€“ Listens for the reflected sound waves (echo).  

The process works as follows:  
1. The **transmitter** generates a brief ultrasonic pulse, typically at **40 kHz**.  
2. This pulse travels through the air until it **hits an object**.  
3. The sound wave then **bounces back** to the **receiver**.  
4. The sensor calculates the **time taken** for the sound to travel to the object and return.  
5. Using the known **speed of sound in air (343 m/s)**, the **distance** to the object is determined using the formula:  


 $$
  \text{Distance} = \frac{\text{Speed of Sound} \times \text{Time}}{2}
  $$  

The division by **2** is necessary because the signal travels to the object and back.


### **Understanding the Speed of Sound**  
The speed of sound depends on factors like **temperature, humidity, and air pressure**. Under **normal conditions (at 20Â°C)**, sound travels at **343 meters per second**. If temperature increases, sound moves **slightly faster**, affecting the sensorâ€™s accuracy.

### **Key Features of Ultrasonic Sensors**  
- **Non-contact measurement**: Ideal for detecting obstacles without physical contact.  
- **Works in various environments**: Can operate in **darkness, fog, and dust**, unlike optical sensors.  
- **Accuracy & reliability**: Provides **precise** distance measurements for robotics and automation.  

### **Real-World Applications**  
- **Automotive parking sensors**: Detects nearby objects when reversing a vehicle.  
- **Robotics and obstacle avoidance**: Helps robots navigate without colliding.  
- **Industrial automation**: Used in conveyor belts to detect and sort objects.  
- **Medical applications**: Utilized in **ultrasound imaging** for scanning internal organs.  

By understanding how an **ultrasonic sensor works**, we can apply this knowledge to **real-world problem-solving**, including **conceptual space debris detection!** ðŸš€

## **Code: Detecting Objects and Glowing LED**
Below is the **code implementation** to interface the **ultrasonic sensor** and turn on an **LED** when an object is detected **within a critical range**.

```cpp
#define TRIG_PIN 7  // Define trigger pin
#define ECHO_PIN 4  // Define echo pin
#define LED_PIN 2   // Define LED pin
#define THRESHOLD_DISTANCE 10 // Set threshold distance in cm

void setup() {
  pinMode(TRIG_PIN, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(ECHO_PIN, INPUT);
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  long duration;
  float distance;

  // Send ultrasonic pulse
  digitalWrite(TRIG_PIN, LOW);
  delayMicroseconds(2);
  digitalWrite(TRIG_PIN, HIGH);
  delayMicroseconds(10);
  digitalWrite(TRIG_PIN, LOW);

  // Measure the time for echo signal
  duration = pulseIn(ECHO_PIN, HIGH);

  // Calculate distance in cm
  distance = (duration * 0.0343) / 2;

  Serial.print("Distance: ");
  Serial.print(distance);
  Serial.println(" cm");

  // Turn on LED if object is too close
  if (distance < THRESHOLD_DISTANCE) {
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);
  } else {
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);
  }

  delay(500);
}
```
