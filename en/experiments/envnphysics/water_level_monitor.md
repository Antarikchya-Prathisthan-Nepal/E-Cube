# Using E-Cube to Monitor Water Levels with an Ultrasonic Sensor

## Introduction

In this experiment, we will use an **E-Cube** microcontroller in combination with an **ultrasonic sensor** to monitor water levels. The ultrasonic sensor will measure the distance between the sensor and the water surface, enabling us to determine whether the water level is high or low.

## How It Works

The **ultrasonic sensor** emits sound waves and measures the time taken for these waves to bounce back. The sensor calculates the distance by comparing how long it took for the sound waves to return. A shorter time indicates a closer object, such as the water surface, and a longer time indicates a more distant object.

## **How Does an Ultrasonic Sensor Work?**  

An **ultrasonic sensor** is a device that measures **distance** using **sound waves**. It operates on the principle of **echolocation**, similar to how **bats, dolphins, and submarines** detect objects in their surroundings.  

### **Working Principle**  
The sensor consists of two main components:  
1. **Transmitter** – Sends out high-frequency sound waves (ultrasound).  
2. **Receiver** – Listens for the reflected sound waves (echo).  

The process works as follows:  
1. The **transmitter** generates a brief ultrasonic pulse, typically at **40 kHz**.  
2. This pulse travels through the air until it **hits an object**.  
3. The sound wave then **bounces back** to the **receiver**.  
4. The sensor calculates the **time taken** for the sound to travel to the object and return.  
5. Using the known **speed of sound in air (343 m/s)**, the **distance** to the object is determined using the formula:  


 $$
  \text{Distance} = \frac{\text{Speed of Sound} \times \text{Time}}{2}
  $$  

The division by **2** is necessary because the signal travels to the object and back.


### **Key Features of Ultrasonic Sensors**  
- **Non-contact measurement**: Ideal for detecting obstacles without physical contact.  
- **Works in various environments**: Can operate in **darkness, fog, and dust**, unlike optical sensors.  
- **Accuracy & reliability**: Provides **precise** distance measurements for robotics and automation.  

### **Real-World Applications**  
- **Automotive parking sensors**: Detects nearby objects when reversing a vehicle.  
- **Robotics and obstacle avoidance**: Helps robots navigate without colliding.  
- **Industrial automation**: Used in conveyor belts to detect and sort objects.  
- **Medical applications**: Utilized in **ultrasound imaging** for scanning internal organs.  

By understanding how an **ultrasonic sensor works**, we can apply this knowledge to **real-world problem-solving**, including **conceptual space debris detection!** 🚀

## **Code: Detecting Objects and Glowing LED**
Below is the **code implementation** to interface the **ultrasonic sensor** and turn on an **LED** when an object is detected **within a critical range**.

```cpp
#define TRIG_PIN 7  // Define trigger pin
#define ECHO_PIN 4  // Define echo pin
#define LED_PIN 2   // Define LED pin
#define THRESHOLD_DISTANCE 10 // Set threshold distance in cm

void setup() {
  pinMode(TRIG_PIN, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(ECHO_PIN, INPUT);
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  long duration;
  float distance;

  // Send ultrasonic pulse
  digitalWrite(TRIG_PIN, LOW);
  delayMicroseconds(2);
  digitalWrite(TRIG_PIN, HIGH);
  delayMicroseconds(10);
  digitalWrite(TRIG_PIN, LOW);

  // Measure the time for echo signal
  duration = pulseIn(ECHO_PIN, HIGH);

  // Calculate distance in cm
  distance = (duration * 0.0343) / 2;

  Serial.print("Distance: ");
  Serial.print(distance);
  Serial.println(" cm");

  // Turn on LED if object is too close
  if (distance < THRESHOLD_DISTANCE) {
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);
  } else {
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);
  }

  delay(500);
}
```
