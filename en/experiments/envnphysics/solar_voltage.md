# **Measuring Solar Panel Output Voltage in Different Conditions**

Solar panels generate electricity by converting sunlight into electrical energy using photovoltaic (PV) cells. However, their output voltage varies depending on environmental factors like sunlight intensity, temperature, angle of incidence, and shading. In this guide, we will explore how to measure the output voltage of a solar panel under different conditions and analyze its performance.

## **How Does a Solar Panel Generate Voltage?**

A solar panel consists of multiple **photovoltaic cells**, which generate electricity through the **photoelectric effect**. When sunlight strikes the surface of a PV cell:
1. **Photons** in sunlight excite electrons in the semiconductor material.
2. The movement of these electrons creates a potential difference (voltage).
3. When connected to a circuit, this potential difference drives current, producing electrical power.

The output voltage of a solar panel depends on the number of **series-connected cells**, as each cell typically produces around **0.5V to 0.6V** under ideal conditions.

## **Factors Affecting Solar Panel Voltage Output**
Several environmental and external factors influence the voltage output of a solar panel:

### **1. Sunlight Intensity**
- More sunlight means more photon energy, resulting in a **higher voltage output**.
- Cloudy or overcast conditions reduce sunlight intensity, **decreasing the voltage**.

### **2. Angle of Incidence**
- The angle at which sunlight strikes the panel affects its efficiency.
- **Best results** occur when the panel is **perpendicular** to the sun’s rays.
- A tilted or incorrectly positioned panel will produce **less voltage**.

### **3. Temperature Effects**
- Higher temperatures **reduce** a solar panel’s voltage output due to increased resistance.
- Lower temperatures **increase** efficiency and maintain a higher voltage.

### **4. Partial Shading**
- Even a small shadow on the panel can cause a significant **drop in voltage**.
- Shading affects individual cells, disrupting the entire panel's output.

### **5. Load Resistance**
- Connecting different loads (e.g., batteries, resistors) impacts voltage levels.
- High resistance loads cause a slight **increase** in voltage, while low resistance loads **reduce** it.



## **Measuring Solar Panel Voltage Using a E-Cube**
E-Cube allows us to capture **real-time analog data** from the solar panel and convert it into voltage readings.

### **How It Works**
1. The **solar panel** is connected to the **E-Cube's ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)**.
2. E-Cube reads the **analog voltage** from the panel.
3. The raw ADC value is converted to actual voltage using a formula.
4. The data is displayed or logged for analysis.

## **Components Required**

## **Steps to Measure Solar Panel Voltage Using E-Cube**

### **Step 1: Short JP2 Jumper for Solar Voltage Measurement**
In **E-Cube**, the ADC connection requires the **JP2 jumper to be shorted**. Without this, the solar panel output will not be correctly fed into the analog input pin.

- Locate **JP2** on the E-Cube board.
- Use a jumper wire or solder to **short JP2** to enable the solar voltage measurement feature.

### **Step 2: Solar Panel Connection to IO3 of E-Cube**
In E-Cube, the **solar panel is already connected to IO3**, which serves as the **ADC input pin**.

- **No extra wiring is needed** for the connection.
- Ensure the **GND is properly connected** for accurate readings.

### **Step 3: Set Up E-Cube for Analog Voltage Measurement**
- Ensure E-Cube is powered on and connected to your **PC** for data logging.
- The **IO3 pin** will read **raw analog values** from the solar panel.

### **Step 4: Write and Upload the Code**
- Use the following code to read and convert **ADC values to voltage**:

```cpp
const int solarPin = IO3;  // ADC pin connected to solar panel
float voltage;
const float referenceVoltage = 3.3; // E-Cube ADC reference voltage
const int maxADC = 4095; // 12-bit ADC

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
    int sensorValue = analogRead(solarPin);
    voltage = (sensorValue / float(maxADC)) * referenceVoltage;
    
    Serial.print("Solar Panel Voltage: ");
    Serial.print(voltage);
    Serial.println(" V");
    
    delay(1000); // Read every second
}
```
   ## **Code Breakdown**  

### **1. Define the ADC Pin**  
```cpp
const int solarPin = IO3
```
- Defines **solarPin** as **IO3**, where the solar panel is connected.
- This pin is used to read **analog** voltage values.

### **2. Define Variables**

 ```cpp
 float voltage;
const float referenceVoltage = 3.3;
const int maxADC = 4095;
 ```
- **Voltage :** Stores the calculated voltage value.

- **referenceVoltage = 3.3V :** The ADC reference voltage is 3.3V.

- **maxADC = 4095 :** Since E-Cube has a 12-bit ADC, the maximum value is 4095

### **3. Initialize Serial Communication**

 ```cpp
void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
}
 ```
- Starts serial communication at **9600** baud.

- This is required to display **voltage** readings in the **Serial Monitor**.

### **4. Read Analog Value from Solar Panel**

 ```cpp
void loop() {
    int sensorValue = analogRead(solarPin);

 ```
- Reads the **analog** value from IO3 using **analogRead()**.

### **5. Convert ADC Value to Voltage**

 ```cpp
    voltage = (sensorValue / float(maxADC)) * referenceVoltage;

 ```

- Converts the **ADC** reading into actual **voltage** using the formula:  

$$
V = \frac{ADC Value}{Max ADC}\times \ Referance Voltage
$$

### **6. Display the Voltage on Serial Monitor**
 ```cpp
    Serial.print("Solar Panel Voltage: ");
    Serial.print(voltage);
    Serial.println(" V");

 ```
- Displays the calculated **voltage** on the **Serial Monitor**.
- Allows real-time monitoring of **solar panel** output.

### **7. Add Delay for Stability**

```cpp
    delay(1000);
}

```
- Introduces a **1-second delay** before taking the next measurement.
- Prevents excessive data output and ensures **stable** readings.
