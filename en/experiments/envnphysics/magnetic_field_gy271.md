# Measuring Earth's Magnetic Field Strength using E-Cube

In this guide, we will explore the concept of magnetic fields, how the GY-271 sensor (QMC5883L magnetometer) works, and how to use it to measure magnetic field strength. This is a great resource for students, hobbyists, and educators interested in electronics and physics.

## What is a Magnetic Field?

A **magnetic field** is a vector field that describes the magnetic influence on moving electric charges, electric currents, and magnetic materials. Magnetic fields are produced by moving electric charges and the intrinsic magnetic moments of elementary particles associated with a fundamental quantum property called spin.

### Key Properties of Magnetic Fields:
- **Direction**: Magnetic fields have both magnitude and direction.
- **Units**: Measured in **Tesla (T)** or **Gauss (G)** (1 Tesla = 10,000 Gauss).
- **Sources**: Generated by magnets, electric currents, and changing electric fields.

## How Does the GY-271 Sensor Work?

The **GY-271** module features the **QMC5883L** magnetometer, a 3-axis magnetic sensor that detects the Earth's magnetic field. It is commonly used in compassing, navigation, and other applications requiring magnetic field measurements.

### Key Features of the QMC5883L:
1. **3-Axis Magnetic Sensing**:
   - Measures magnetic field strength in the X, Y, and Z axes.
2. **Wide Measurement Range**:
   - Can detect magnetic fields in the range of **±8 Gauss**.
3. **High Resolution**:
   - Provides 16-bit output for each axis, ensuring precise measurements.
4. **I2C Interface**:
   - Communicates with microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino, ESP32) via the I2C protocol.
5. **Built-in Temperature Sensor**:
   - Compensates for temperature effects on magnetic field measurements.

### Code Example:

```cpp
#include <Wire.h>

// QMC5883L I2C address
#define QMC5883L_ADDRESS 0x0D

// Registers
#define QMC5883L_REG_X_LSB 0x00
#define QMC5883L_REG_X_MSB 0x01
#define QMC5883L_REG_Y_LSB 0x02
#define QMC5883L_REG_Y_MSB 0x03
#define QMC5883L_REG_Z_LSB 0x04
#define QMC5883L_REG_Z_MSB 0x05
#define QMC5883L_REG_STATUS 0x06
#define QMC5883L_REG_CONFIG_1 0x09
#define QMC5883L_REG_CONFIG_2 0x0A

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Wire.begin();
  initQMC5883L();
}

void loop() {
  int16_t x, y, z;
  readMagneticField(&x, &y, &z);

  Serial.print("X: "); Serial.print(x);
  Serial.print("  Y: "); Serial.print(y);
  Serial.print("  Z: "); Serial.println(z);

  delay(500);
}

void initQMC5883L() {
  Wire.beginTransmission(QMC5883L_ADDRESS);
  Wire.write(QMC5883L_REG_CONFIG_1);
  Wire.write(0x1D); // Set to continuous measurement mode, 200Hz data rate, 8 Gauss range
  Wire.endTransmission();

  Wire.beginTransmission(QMC5883L_ADDRESS);
  Wire.write(QMC5883L_REG_CONFIG_2);
  Wire.write(0x00); // Set to default settings
  Wire.endTransmission();
}

void readMagneticField(int16_t *x, int16_t *y, int16_t *z) {
  Wire.beginTransmission(QMC5883L_ADDRESS);
  Wire.write(QMC5883L_REG_X_LSB);
  Wire.endTransmission();

  Wire.requestFrom(QMC5883L_ADDRESS, 6);
  *x = (int16_t)(Wire.read() | Wire.read() << 8);
  *y = (int16_t)(Wire.read() | Wire.read() << 8);
  *z = (int16_t)(Wire.read() | Wire.read() << 8);
}
```

### Code Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The `initQMC5883L()` function configures the sensor for continuous measurement mode with a data rate of 200Hz and a range of ±8 Gauss.
   - The I2C communication is initialized using `Wire.begin()`.

2. **Reading Data**:
   - The `readMagneticField()` function reads the raw magnetic field values for the X, Y, and Z axes from the sensor registers.
   - The raw values are combined into 16-bit integers.

3. **Output**:
   - The raw values are printed to the Serial Monitor for observation.

### Converting Raw Data to Magnetic Field Strength:

The raw values from the sensor can be converted to magnetic field strength (in Gauss) using the sensor's sensitivity. For the QMC5883L:
- **Sensitivity**: 12000 LSB/Gauss (for ±8 Gauss range).
- Formula:  

  $$
  \text{Magnetic Field Strength (Gauss)} = \frac{\text{Raw Value}}{\text{Sensitivity}}
  $$

For example:
- If the raw X-axis value is `6000`, the magnetic field strength is:

  $$
  \frac{6000}{12000} = 0.5 \, \text{Gauss}
  $$
