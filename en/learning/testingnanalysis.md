# Testing and Analysis

Testing and analysis are critical for ensuring that a CubeSat structure will withstand the
harsh environment of space, including the launch, on-orbit operations, and reentry. Normally,
once the mission is designed and developed, it is subjected to all sort of tests to see it’s
spaceworthiness. The launchers also require evidences of several tests performed in a satellite
so that the CubeSat is not a liability and doesn’t actively effect the primary payload that it
is hitching the ride from. There are several types of testing and analysis that are typically
required for a 1U CubeSat structure, including:

   - <b>Structural testing:</b> This type of testing is used to verify the structural integrity of
the CubeSat structure and its ability to withstand the loads and vibrations that it
will experience during launch. This includes testing for launch loads, thermal cycles,
vibration, and shock.
   - <b>Fatigue testing:</b> This type of testing is used to verify that the CubeSat structure can
withstand the repeated loads and vibrations it will experience during its lifetime.
   - <b>Thermal testing:</b> This type of testing is used to verify the thermal performance of the
CubeSat structure and its ability to survive the extreme temperatures of space. This
includes testing for solar radiation, conduction, and convection.
   - <b>Material testing:</b> This type of testing is used to verify that the materials used in
the CubeSat structure meet the required mechanical and thermal properties and can
withstand the space environment.
   - <b>Environmental testing:</b> This type of testing is used to verify that the CubeSat structure
can withstand the harsh environment of space, including vacuum, radiation, and
extreme temperatures.
   - <b>Finite Element Analysis (FEA)</b> This type of analysis is used to simulate the loads,
stresses and strains that the CubeSat structure will experience during launch and
operations. This allows for optimization of the design and identification of potential
failure points.
   - <b>Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)</b> This type of analysis is used to simulate the
thermal and fluid flow characteristics of the CubeSat structure. This allows for opti-
mization of the thermal design and identification of potential thermal failure points.

It’s important to note that the CubeSat structure should be designed in a way that allows
for easy access for testing, maintenance and repair and also it should be designed in a way
that it can be easily integrated into different payloads or subsystems. In addition to the
testing and analysis mentioned above, there are several other considerations that should be
taken into account when designing a 1U CubeSat structure. These include:

 - *Design margins*: The structure should be designed with adequate margins to ensure
that it can withstand the loads and environments it will experience during launch and
on-orbit operations.
 - *Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)/ Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC)*: The structure
should be designed to minimize EMI and EMC issues, which can affect the performance
of electronic subsystems.
 - *Outgassing*: The structure should be designed to minimize outgassing, which can
contaminate other spacecraft and instruments.
 - *Mass and volume constraints*: The structure should be designed to be as lightweight
and compact as possible, to maximize the available volume for other subsystems and
payloads.

 - *Compatibility with launch vehicles and dispensers*: The structure should be designed to be
compatible with the launch vehicle and dispenser that will be used for launch.

 - *Cost*: The structure should be designed to minimize costs, while still meeting all of the
requirements for the mission.

 - *Durability*: The structure should be designed to withstand the harsh environment of
space and last for the duration of the mission, taking into account the factors such as
radiation, thermal and mechanical loads.

 - *Space debris*: The structure should be designed to minimize the risk of creating space
debris, by ensuring that all parts remain attached to the CubeSat during launch, ejection
and operation.

 - *Standardization*: The structure should be designed to be compliant with relevant stan-
dards and regulations, such as National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA),
Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), European Space Agency (ESA) CubeSat
standards.

Overall, designing a 1U CubeSat structure requires a balance between competing require-
ments, such as mass, volume, cost, and performance. The design process should be iterative,
with multiple rounds of testing and analysis to optimize the design and ensure that it meets
all of the requirements for the mission.
