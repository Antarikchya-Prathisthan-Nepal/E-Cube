Most of satellite mission designers and engineers follow the quote by William of Ockham
while thinking about their satellite mission. In his Summa Totius Logicae [7], William of
Ockham cites the principle of economy, Frustra fit per plura quod potest fieri per pauciora ("It
is futile to do with more things that which can be done with fewer"; Thorburn, 1918, pp.
352–53; Kneale and Kneale, 1962, p. 243.) In other words, it is recommended that we don’t complicate the process of designing just for the sake of designing. It comes to us, the
designers, to ensure that the mission is fairly simple and effective. The redundant systems,
should be kept to minimum. A system with high number of redundant subsystems would
cause nothing but issues in the long haul. One has to be absolutely certain what do they
expect from the mission and how to accomplish it.

The objective of the mission should be known and all the subsystems must be designed
in such a way that fulfills the objective. Most of times, a tradeoff must be made, in order
to manage the expectations from the system. Sometimes the newest or the most advanced
system is not required to get the outcome required from a mission, that is where one has to do
tradeoff where they (the designers) purposefully choose a less advanced system to adhere to
the constraints (SWaP or budgetary or launcher or any other) and make sure the system still
functions perfectly. Also, while designing a mission, one has to also be specifically aware of
the SWaP requirements of CubeSats. Most often, the designers get carried away with the fact
that they are making a satellite and dream big. It is a fair assumption and also the enthusiasm
of making a satellite trumps the realistic situation. One has to be grounded with the fact that
there are fairly less things to be done in a 1U satellite than the conventional satellite. If, that
fact is processed initially, that would also save us from a lot of disappointment in the days of
mission design.

While designing the orbit, one also has to be aware of the launcher requirements and work
with them. An orbit has to be designed in a way that also performs amicably with good
results also adhere to the launcher’s requirements. That becomes an important part.

Also, depending on the mission, temporal and spatial resolution of the satellite must be also
considered. As orbit also contributes directly to the charging of the batteries (sunfacing time
and eclipse times), that too has to be considered and must be designed in the most feasible
way so that everything works effectively. The ground station passing time and the link budget
also has to be looked into and has to be designed effectively so that the designers encounter
the least disturbances.
