# Introduction

In this section, we will discuss satellite mission design and all the subsections that need to be addressed before mission development or production. For a CubeSat to function properly, the designers and engineers must first be clear about what they expect from the satellite. They must have a clear objective regarding where the satellite will be deployed, what it will do, how the data it collects will contribute to the existing data pool, how feasible the mission is given the SWaP requirements, why the mission is being designed, and how the designers or engineers will achieve the expected outcomes from the system. A proper mission design plan helps answer all these questions and provides a robust roadmap for the development and production of the mission. Experts suggest keeping the mission plan simple and less convoluted, as complexity can pose problems in the production phase of the satellite.

When engineers or designers from developing countries build a satellite, there are different factors that they must address. The entire design procedure must be carried out with meticulous attention to detail, as the outcome of this process will be deployed in space. In this chapter, we will cover all the aspects that one must be aware of before making a satellite.
